In the cryptic hum of digital dawn,
Where trust once faltered, now it’s reborn.
Blocks aligned in silent might,
Each hash a beacon, burning bright.

Immutable chains, one link at a time,
Consensus carved without a crime.
No lords or kings, just code that stands,
A ledger etched by many hands.

Enter Rust, with fearless tone,
A warrior's blade, forged in its own.
No nulls to haunt, no threads to race,
Just safety, speed, and fearless grace.

Smart contracts whisper truth and trade,
In WASM dreams, the nodes cascade.
Stylus paves a brighter path,
Low-level power, high-level math.

From DAOs to DeFi, bridges span,
Rust builds what the bold began.
Where gas is scarce and trust is key,
Rust and chains craft destiny.

So here's to builders, brave and just,
Who write with fire, who write with Rust.
The Web3 age is not far-fetched—
Its story now is being etched.
